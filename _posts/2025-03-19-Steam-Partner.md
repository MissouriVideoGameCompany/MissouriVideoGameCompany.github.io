## Breaking Through the Steamworkshop Labyrinth: MV-GC is Now a Steam Partner!
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->



It’s official! Missouri Video Game Company LLC (MV-GC) has successfully navigated the intricate maze that is Steamworks, and we are now a Steam Partner!

For those unfamiliar, getting a game onto Steam isn’t as simple as just hitting an upload button. The process involves legal agreements, tax documentation, setting up payment systems, and verifying your company details—all before even thinking about launching a game. It’s been a journey, but I’m thrilled to say that MV-GC is now in a position to bring our games directly to players on one of the biggest PC gaming platforms in the world.

This milestone is a huge step toward making our first game a reality. With Steamworks access secured, I can now start integrating key features like achievements, cloud saves, and community content—things that make games feel polished and engaging.

What’s next? I’ll be sharing updates on our first project soon, including sneak peeks at gameplay, design choices, and what players can expect from MV-GC’s debut title. If you’re interested in following along, stay tuned—this is just the beginning!
